\chapter{Wireless MAC}


Usually in a home there are a lot of wireless devices: there are different
requirements, from low delay to high bandwith availability and high reliability.

\textit{Home routers} can be a bottleneck\footnote{
  Typically the bottlenecks are at the edges of the network:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Server bandwith
  \item Last mile to router
  \item In gome routers (wireless bandwith)
  \end{itemize}
}
of the network traffic, acting as a Gateway between in-home devices and the
outside world.
Most network protocols developed assuming mostly TCP-based traffic. This
assumption needs a radical reconsideration when UDP-based services for
entertainment come into picture (because it's extermely delay sensitive).

\section{Issues}

One of the issue of wireless MAC is the packet retransmission, that cause delays
that can be extremely dangerous for UDP-based services. This delay is increased
with long TCP flows (e.g. FTP).

\subsection{Solutions}

In order to solve this problem several solutions were implemented. The first
solution is to set the MAC packet retransmission to 3. This will ensure the
maximum throughput\footnote{
  The throughput is the maximum rate of production or the maximum rate at which
  something can be processed in networking: is the rate of successful message
  delivery over a comunication channel.
}
possible.
